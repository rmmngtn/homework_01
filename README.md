#01 Refactorization of Horiseon Social Solutions Services Website
    
 
    Given the framework and initial code for this website, the objective was to refactor this code for web accessibility and brevity. Additionally, with the newest versions of both HTML and CSS, semantic tags replaced unspecified <div> tags, allowing for better reading of code and rendering of webpages. Along with restructuring the HTML and CSS files, these standards allow the company to meet their goals of increased web optimization and reach, and provides long-term sustainability.
